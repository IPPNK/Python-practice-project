# Python-practice-project
    Python practice project is for fun and continuous improvement coding skills;
    Every code is original written by JohnZhong;
    The subjects and requirements of codes are came from Google Search and the website:
    https://www.upgrad.com/blog/python-projects-ideas-topics-beginners; 
    Hope this project may help people new to python;
    Everyone can contribute to the project by finding bugs or give some advises;
    The project begins in 2021-10-14;
    To be continue...

# 01Guess_number_game
   This is one of the simple python projects yet an exciting one. You can even call 
   it a mini-game. Make a program in which the computer randomly chooses a number 
   between 1 and 10, 1 and 100, or any range. Then give users a hint to guess the number. 
   Every time the user guesses wrong, he gets another clue, and his score gets reduced. 
   The clue can be multiples, divisible, greater or smaller, or a combination of all.
   You will also need functions to compare the inputted number with the guessed number, 
   to compute the difference between the two, and to check whether an actual number was 
   inputted or not in this python project.
# 02Mad_libs_generator
   One of the best ideas to start experimenting you hands-on python projects for students 
   is working on Mad Libs Generator. This is the perfect project for beginners who are just 
   starting out with software development. Primarily focused on strings, variables, and concatenation, 
   this project will teach you how to manipulate user-inputted data. The program design is such 
   that it will ask users to enter a series of inputs that will be considered as a Mad Lib. Mab lib 
   is one of the python projects for beginners.
   The input could be anything, an adjective, a noun, a pronoun, etc. Once all the inputs are entered, 
   the application will take the data and arrange the inputs into a story template form. Sound fun, right?
# 03Dice_rolling_simulator
   As the name of the program suggests, we will be imitating a rolling dice. This is one of the interesting
   python projects and will generate a random number each dice the program runs, and the users can use 
   the dice repeatedly for as long as he wants. When the user rolls the dice, the program will generate 
   a random number between 1 and 6 (as on a standard dice).
   The number will then be displayed to the user. It will also ask users if they would like to roll the 
   dice again. The program should also include a function that can randomly grab a number within 1 to 6 
   and print it. This beginner-level python projects will help build a strong foundation for fundamental 
   programming concepts. 
# 04Hangman
   This is more of a “guess the word” game. The core concepts you have to use while developing this project 
   are variables, random, integer, strings, char, input and output, and boolean. In the game, users have to 
   enter letter guesses, and each user will have a limited number of guesses (a counter variable is needed 
   for limiting the guesses). This is one of the interesting python projects to begin with. 
   You can create a pre-organized list of words that users can grab words from. Also, you must include 
   specific functions to check whether or not a user has entered a single letter or if the input letter is in 
   the hidden word, to if the user has actually inputted a single letter, and to print the correct outcomes (letters).
# 05Email_slicer
  This is one of the convenient python projects that has a lot of use in the future. The program helps get you the 
  username and domain name from an email address. You can even customize the application and send a message to the 
  host with this information.
# 06Binary_search_algorithm
  Have you ever heard the proverb, “finding a needle in a haystack.” This program is designed to do just that- by using 
  a binary search algorithm. You can create a list of random numbers between 0 to 100, with every succeeding number 
  having a difference of 2 between them.
