# 01Guess_number_game
   This is one of the simple python projects yet an exciting one. You can even call 
   it a mini-game. Make a program in which the computer randomly chooses a number 
   between 1 and 10, 1 and 100, or any range. Then give users a hint to guess the number. 
   Every time the user guesses wrong, he gets another clue, and his score gets reduced. 
   The clue can be multiples, divisible, greater or smaller, or a combination of all.
   You will also need functions to compare the inputted number with the guessed number, 
   to compute the difference between the two, and to check whether an actual number was 
   inputted or not in this python project.
