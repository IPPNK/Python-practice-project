# Python-practice-project
    Python practice project is for fun and continuous improvement coding skills;
    Every code is original written by JohnZhong;
    The subjects and requirements of codes are came from Google Search and the website:
    https://www.upgrad.com/blog/python-projects-ideas-topics-beginners; 
    Hope this project may help people new to python;
    Everyone can contribute to the project by finding bugs or give some advises;
    The project begins in 2021-10-14;
    To be continue...

# 01Guess_number_game
   This is one of the simple python projects yet an exciting one. You can even call 
   it a mini-game. Make a program in which the computer randomly chooses a number 
   between 1 and 10, 1 and 100, or any range. Then give users a hint to guess the number. 
   Every time the user guesses wrong, he gets another clue, and his score gets reduced. 
   The clue can be multiples, divisible, greater or smaller, or a combination of all.
   You will also need functions to compare the inputted number with the guessed number, 
   to compute the difference between the two, and to check whether an actual number was 
   inputted or not in this python project.
# 02Mad_libs_generator
   One of the best ideas to start experimenting you hands-on python projects for students 
   is working on Mad Libs Generator. This is the perfect project for beginners who are just 
   starting out with software development. Primarily focused on strings, variables, and concatenation, 
   this project will teach you how to manipulate user-inputted data. The program design is such 
   that it will ask users to enter a series of inputs that will be considered as a Mad Lib. Mab lib 
   is one of the python projects for beginners.
   The input could be anything, an adjective, a noun, a pronoun, etc. Once all the inputs are entered, 
   the application will take the data and arrange the inputs into a story template form. Sound fun, right?
# 03Dice_rolling_simulator
   As the name of the program suggests, we will be imitating a rolling dice. This is one of the interesting
   python projects and will generate a random number each dice the program runs, and the users can use 
   the dice repeatedly for as long as he wants. When the user rolls the dice, the program will generate 
   a random number between 1 and 6 (as on a standard dice).
   The number will then be displayed to the user. It will also ask users if they would like to roll the 
   dice again. The program should also include a function that can randomly grab a number within 1 to 6 
   and print it. This beginner-level python projects will help build a strong foundation for fundamental 
   programming concepts.
